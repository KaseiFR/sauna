Consumers
=========

Consumers provide a way for sauna to process the checks generated by :ref:`plugins <plugins>`. The
most common job for a consumer is to send the results to a monitoring server, but it can go beyond
that.

Consumers are enabled in :ref:`sauna.yml <configuration_consumers>`

.. todo:: Find a way to automatically document core consumers. For now you can find the list of
          `consumers on GitHub
          <https://github.com/NicolasLM/sauna/tree/master/sauna/consumers/ext>`_.

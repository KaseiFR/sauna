Configuration
=============

Location
--------

Sauna configuration is made of a single yaml file. By default it loads ``sauna.yml`` in the current
directory. You can load another configuration file with the ``--config`` switch::

    $ sauna --config /etc/sauna.yml

.. note:: This configuration file might end up containing secrets to access your monitoring server.
          It is a good idea not to make it world readable. Only the user running sauna needs to
          be able to read it.

Quickstart
----------

Sometimes simply editing a configuration file feels easier than reading documentation. You can
generate a default configuration file::

    $ sauna sample
    Created file ./sauna-sample.yml

You can adapt this default configuration to fit your needs, when you are ready rename it and launch
sauna::

   $ mv sauna-sample.yml sauna.yml

Content
-------

The configuration yaml file contains three parts:

* Generic parameters
* Active consumers
* Active plugins

Generic parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All these parameters can be left out, in this case they take their default value.

**periodicity**
    How often, in seconds, will checks be run. The default value of 120, means that sauna will run
    all checks every two minutes.

**hostname**
    The name of the host that will be reported to monitoring servers. The default value is the
    fully qualified domain name of your host.

**extra_plugins**
    A list of directories where :ref:`additional plugins <custom>` can be found. Defaults to no
    extra directory, meaning it does not load plugins beyond the core ones.

Example::

    ---
    periodicity: 10
    extra_plugins:
      - /opt/sauna_plugins

.. _configuration_consumers:

Active consumers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mapping of the consumers you want to process your checks. It defines how sauna will interact with
your monitoring server(s).

Example::
   
    ---
    consumers:

      NSCA:
        server: receiver.shinken.tld
        port: 5667
        timeout: 10

Many consumers can be active at the same time.

.. _configuration_plugins:

Active plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of plugins and associated checks. 

Example::

    ---
    plugins:

    # Usage of disks
    - type: Disk
      checks:
        - type: used_percent
          warn: 80%
          crit: 90%
        - type: used_inodes_percent
          warn: 80%
          crit: 90%
 
A plugin may be defined many times in the list. This allows to run the same checks with different
configurations parameters.

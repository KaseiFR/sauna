Sauna is a lightweight daemon designed to run health checks and send the results to a monitoring
server.

Sauna comes batteries included, it is able run many system checks (load, memory, disk...) as well
as monitor applications (redis, memcached, puppet...). It is easily :ref:`extensible <custom>` to
include your own checks and can even run the thousands of existing :ref:`Nagios plugins <nagios>`.

Painless monitoring of your servers is just a pip install away::

    pip install sauna
